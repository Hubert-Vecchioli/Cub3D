Recreation of the Wolfenstein 3D raycasting system, using MiniLibX.

Use `make` to compile the program into an executable `./cub3D`. Then run `./cub3D` followed by the relative path to a .cub map. (Refer to the subject for map creation details.)

Use `make bonus` to generate more features such as animated sprits, a minimap, and doors - opened by `E`.
The maps folder contains some sample maps, and the bonus/maps_bonus folder contains additional maps designed specifically for the bonus.
